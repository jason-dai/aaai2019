- *__Easy-to-use abstractions and APIs__*: Spark Dataframe and ML pipeline support, auto-differentiation operations, transfer learning support, online model serving API, etc. 
- *__Built-in deep learning models__*: image classification, object detection, text classification, recommendation, etc. 
- *__Reference use cases__*: anomaly detection, sentiment analysis, fraud detection, image augmentation, object detection, variational autoencoder, etc.
